# Organize your directories nicely
Often we have multiple files of different types(mp3, mp4, xls, pdf, e.t.c) messed up in our hard disks, especially Downloads/ directory. Organizing can be a time consuming process and chances are you might be lazy.
Just run this script and phewww. Brand new clean directories at hand.

**Dependencies:** Python3.x

**Note-** Don't put the script (org.py) in the directory you want to clean. Put it right outside it (parent directory w.r.t the directory you want to clean)
Eg- Considereing Linux FHS, if you want to clean your Downloads/ directory (which is in Home/), so put the script in Home/ (~/)

Now run (From Home/)-

**python3 org.py Downloads/**

Script is easily readable and customizable according to user preference. Feel free to change it your way.
